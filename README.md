Binary_Search_Tree

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.

* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

* The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
